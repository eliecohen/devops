DevOps is not about the cloud, not about a set of practices or culture patterns, not about Docker or Kubernetes, nor CI or CD. It’s only about business processes improvement and optimization applied to software development. Yes, it’s all about money.

It’s all about simplicity (chapter 1), processes (chapter 2), operations (chapter 3), agility (chapter 4), visibility (chapter 5), coding (chapter 5),  architecture (chapter 5),  data (chapter 6), security (chapter 7), naming (chapter 8), and continuous learning (chapter 9).
